I started making the solutions in Javascript (folder `/javascript`), until day 4.

Then I switched to Typescript, as I thought it would be beneficial for the more difficult challenges (folder `/typescript`).

When both files are present (e.g. days 1 to 4), the Typescript files in the repo are **not** the transpilation of the javascript files. They are refactored versions of the initial Javascript solutions.
